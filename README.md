# A Dutch essay corpus with argument structures and quality indicators

This is the first Dutch corpus of essays annotated extensively with argument structures and scores. 

## Annotation schemes
We applied the annotation schemes and guidelines derived from previous studies to capture the argument structures of Dutch argumentative essays by identifying and classifying the argument components into major claims, claims, and premises as well as the support/attack relations between the components based on the work of [Stab and Gurevych (2014)](https://aclanthology.org/C14-1142.pdf). Furthermore, we annotated persuasiveness scores and attributes that influence persuasiveness as quality indicators based on the work of [Carlile et al. (2018)](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1058/). 

## About this work
This work is part of the PhD project to analyse and evaluate the argumentation in Dutch essays and develop an automated essay assessment tool. It is published in the journal Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands Vol.11 (2021) as [Zhang et al. (2022)](https://www.clinjournal.org/index.php/clinj/article/view/139).
